# Smart Todo App

A modern todo application built with Next.js that implements smart task propagation and dependency management. Create tasks with dependencies and watch them update automatically based on their relationships.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [https://smart-todo-umber.vercel.app/](https://smart-todo-umber.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tedhn/smart-todo.git
cd smart-todo
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + ShadcN UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand with persist middleware
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Component Library**: ShadcN UI (built on Radix UI)

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Add dependencies between tasks
- Automatic task status propagation
- Persistent storage using supabase
- Responsive design
- Dark/Light mode support

## Dependency Management Approach

Tasks use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure for dependency management:

1. **Task Creation**: Tasks can be created with zero or more dependencies
2. **Status Propagation**: Completing a task triggers updates to dependent tasks

## Updating Task Status Logic

When a task status is updated, it will find if there are any parent tasks that depends upon this tasks. Using a recursive function , we will keep finding more parents tasks until either:

1. The task has already been visited
2. There are no parent tasks that are dependent on the updating tasks

E.g

```
Task A (complete) â†’ Task B (complete) â†’ Task C (todo)
```

For example if task A were to be set to "todo", the following would happen:

1. Task A changes to "todo"
2. System checks Task B (which depends on A)
   - Since A is not "done", B becomes "blocked"
3. System then checks Task C (which depends on B)
   - Since B is now "blocked", C becomes "blocked"

Final result:

```
Task A (todo) â†’ Task B (blocked) â†’ Task C (blocked)
```

This cascading update ensures that:

- Dependencies are always properly enforced
- Tasks can't be worked on until their dependencies are complete
- Status changes propagate through the entire dependency chain
- Each task is processed only once (thanks to the visited Set)

## Data Structures

- **Tasks**: Array in Zustand store

```typescript
interface ITask {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: "todo" | "in-progress" | "blocked" | "done";
  dependencies: ITaskDependency[]; // ITask type with no dependencies
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

1. **Performance vs Simplicity**

   - Array-based storage for easier state updates
   - O(n) lookup time accepted for smaller datasets
   - Local state management for initial version

2. **Dependency Rules**

   - Tasks can only depend on existing tasks
   - Dependencies are bi-directional (stored in both tasks)

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**

   - RESTful API with Node.js/Express
   - WebSocket real-time updates
   - Validations to avoid circular dependencies

2. **Enhanced Features**

   - Due dates and reminders
   - Priority levels and sorting
   - Task categories and tags
   - Multi-user support
   - Bulk actions
   - Task templates
   - Filtering / Searching Tasks

3. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Add Redis caching layer
   - Optimize dependency graph traversal
   - Batch updates for dependencies

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Increase unit test coverage
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add input validation
   - Improve error handling
